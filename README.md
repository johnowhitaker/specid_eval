# specid_eval

A hard eval for multi-modal models.

This is based on 100 photographs I took of organisms in Southern Africa, with robust species-level identifications. Each comes with up to four other 'distractors' from the same family, and the goal is to correctly guess which is the correct species name. 

Evals on popular models coming soon
